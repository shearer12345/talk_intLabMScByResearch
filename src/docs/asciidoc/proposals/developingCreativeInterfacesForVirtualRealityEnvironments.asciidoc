=== Summary

Newly emerging VR interfaces, such as the HTC Vive, have enabled the creation of digital spaces which mirror the physical world: users can walk, move, and interact with virtual artefacts using naturalistic body movements. This MSc project will explore the development of such spaces to support and explore the process of art creation, using crafting interfaces which are inspired by traditional techniques used in the physical world.

=== Aims

There have already been some initial attempts to develop virtual creative spaces, such as "tilt brush" (http://www.tiltbrush.com/), However, this MSc project will focus on the transposition of traditional techniques (such as stone sculpture) into virtual spaces, and will involve working with non-digital artists to design and evaluate corresponding VR interfaces.

=== Skills

Interested students should have good programming skills, experience of the Unity game engine, and an some understanding of HCI research processes.
